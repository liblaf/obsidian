How to make a good interview design?

### 提问引导师

That's a great question about creating an effective interview design! To think more deeply about this topic, could you clarify what type of interview you're referring to? For example, are you designing an interview for a job position, an academic research study, or perhaps something else? Understanding the context can help refine your question.

### User

I am designing an interview for a course research project. Our research topic is "food and culture".

### 提问引导师

Thank you for providing more context. Designing an interview for a research project on "food and culture" sounds fascinating. Here's a follow-up question: Can you specify what specific aspects of "food and culture" you are interested in exploring through the interviews? For example, are you focusing on traditional food practices, the impact of globalization on cuisine, or the role of food in cultural identity? Providing more detail on the focus of your research can help refine your interview questions.

### User

I'm interested in the impact of globalization on cuisine and the role of food in cultural identity.

### 提问引导师

Great, focusing on the impact of globalization on cuisine and the role of food in cultural identity provides a rich area of study. To refine your interview design further, could you specify who your target interviewees are? For example, are you planning to interview chefs, cultural historians, everyday individuals from various backgrounds, or perhaps food critics? Identifying your target demographic can help tailor your interview questions more effectively.

### User

I'm planning to interview non-local students studying in Beijing.

### 提问引导师

Thank you for specifying your target demographic. Interviewing non-local students in Beijing can provide unique insights into how globalization and cultural identity intersect in the realm of cuisine. To further refine your interview design, what specific outcomes or insights are you hoping to gain from these interviews? For instance, are you looking to understand how these students adapt their dietary habits in a new cultural environment, or how their food experiences in Beijing influence their cultural identity? Clarifying your desired outcomes can help shape more focused and relevant interview questions.

### User

I hope to learn from the interview about the changes in individuals' dietary habits under the influence of globalization, and whether the public's stereotypes of regional cuisine are consistent with those of locals.

### 提问引导师

That's an excellent focus for your interviews, and it will surely yield rich qualitative data! To help you refine your interview design, consider how you will structure your questions to address both the changes in dietary habits and perceptions of regional cuisine stereotypes. For instance, do you have a plan for how to balance questions that explore both personal dietary changes and perceptions versus reality regarding regional cuisines? Having a structured approach can ensure that you cover both aspects comprehensively.

### User

I have no idea.

### 提问引导师

That's okay! Let's explore how you might structure your interview to cover both aspects.

To ensure a balanced approach, you might consider organizing your interview into sections. For example:

1. **Introduction to Personal Dietary Habits:**
   - Begin with questions about the interviewee's dietary habits before arriving in Beijing.
   - Ask about any changes they have experienced since coming to Beijing and what influences (e.g., availability, cultural exchange, personal preferences) prompted these changes.
2. **Impact of Globalization on Cuisine:**
   - Explore how globalization has affected their food choices in Beijing. Have they tried new cuisines? Which global influences do they notice in local food?
3. **Perceptions and Realities of Regional Cuisine:**
   - Inquire about any stereotypes they have encountered regarding regional cuisines.
   - Ask whether their experiences align with those stereotypes and how interacting with locals has shaped their understanding of these cuisines.

Including both open-ended and closed questions can facilitate detailed and diverse responses.

What challenges do you anticipate in gathering data about these aspects during your interviews? Identifying potential obstacles can help refine your approach and ensure comprehensive coverage of your research focus.

### User

I estimate that people may pay less attention to the culture behind food and may find it difficult to answer questions related to culture Besides, we don't have time to conduct extensive interviews, and the results may be greatly influenced by individual differences.

### 提问引导师

You've identified some key challenges in your research approach. It's indeed possible that interviewees may not consciously think about the cultural aspects of food, and time constraints can limit the depth of your interviews. Let's address these concerns:

1. **Addressing Cultural Awareness:**
   - Consider starting with simpler questions to ease interviewees into thinking about culture, such as asking about their favorite dishes and why they like them. Gradually move towards questions that invite reflection on cultural significance, like how they feel their food choices represent or differ from their cultural background.
2. **Managing Time Constraints:**
   - To make the most of your limited time, prioritize your questions by importance. Decide which areas are essential to your research and focus on those.
3. **Mitigating Individual Differences:**
   - You may want to develop a set of questions that can surface patterns or common themes across different individuals. Consistency in questioning can help reveal broader trends, while still allowing room for personal insights.

As you prepare for these interviews, what strategies might you employ to ensure that your questions encourage reflection on culture and allow you to gather meaningful, comparable data across different individuals?

### User

Let's get back track. You should help me refine my question, rather than helping me design interview questions.

### 提问引导师

Absolutely, let's focus on refining your original question. Based on the information you've provided, here's an optimized version of your question:

"How can I design effective interview questions to explore the impact of globalization on dietary habits and cultural identity among non-local students in Beijing, considering time constraints and individual differences?"
