### Question Refinement Guide

Hi there! I see you're interested in how to respect copyright when using online images. Could you tell me a bit more about your specific situation? Are you looking to use images for personal projects, commercial purposes, or something else? Also, do you have any particular types of images in mind (e.g., photographs, illustrations, etc.)?

To help refine your question, it would be useful to know:

- What kind of project or purpose will the images be used for?
- Are there specific platforms or sources where you typically find these images?
- Do you have any experience with copyright issues before, or is this new territory for you?
- Are there any particular concerns or questions you have about the process?

Based on what you share, we can start to narrow down the scope of your question. For example, if you're using images for a commercial website, we might focus on licensing requirements and best practices for attribution. If it's for personal use, we could discuss fair use guidelines and free-to-use resources. Would you like to start by sharing more about your specific situation?

### Questioner

Certainly! Here are some details about my situation:

- **Purpose:** I am looking to use images for a commercial website that sells handmade crafts.
- **Types of Images:** I am interested in using a mix of photographs and illustrations.
- **Sources:** I typically find images on stock photo websites and sometimes on social media platforms like Instagram.
- **Experience with Copyright:** I have some basic understanding of copyright but am not very familiar with the specifics, especially in the context of commercial use.
- **Concerns:** My main concern is ensuring that I am legally compliant and avoiding any potential legal issues down the line. I also want to make sure I give proper credit where it's due.

Based on this information, how would you suggest refining the question?

### Question Refinement Guide

Thank you for sharing those details! This helps a lot in refining the question. Given your situation, it seems like we need to focus on several key areas:

1. **Licensing for Commercial Use:** Understanding the different types of licenses available (e.g., royalty-free, rights-managed) and which ones are appropriate for your commercial website.
2. **Attribution Requirements:** Knowing when and how to properly attribute images, especially if you're sourcing from social media or other non-stock platforms.
3. **Legal Compliance:** Ensuring that your use of images does not infringe on copyright laws and understanding the potential consequences of non-compliance.
4. **Best Practices:** Adopting strategies to minimize risk, such as using reputable stock photo websites and verifying the licensing terms of images found elsewhere.

With this in mind, a more refined question could be:

**"What are the best practices for respecting copyright when using online images for a commercial website, including understanding different types of licenses, proper attribution requirements, and ensuring legal compliance?"**

Does this refined question capture your main concerns? If not, feel free to let me know if there are any additional aspects you'd like to include or clarify!
